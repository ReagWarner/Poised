# Poised

● Create two classes named Teacher and Secretary. Each class should contain:
○ At least five attributes
○ A constructor
○ A toString method to display the values of all the attributes of each
class
● Create a class diagram for the following classes:
○ Student
○ Teacher
○ Secretary
● Edit School.java to check the toString methods you’ve created for each of the classes above. 
To test the toString methods, create three instances of each class (each with different attribute values) and display them as was done for the Student class.
